            <p>    Hi my name is Sarah. I am a student in the National college of Ireland and I am studying Technology Management.  

  

                I am in my first year in this course and just finishing my first semester.  

  

            </p><br/>  

  

            <p>  

  

                I am 18 years old and I live in Dublin. I am doing a web design module and so Sean and I decided to make a website for money management.  

  

            </p><br/>  

  

            <p>  

  

                I am not very good at saving my money and neither is Sean, so we decided to make a website to help students to save  

  

            </p><br/>  

  

            <p>  

  

                I hope you find this website useful as I would have if I had it when I first became a student!
